# Tomato Disease Identification with CNN Models

## Overview
Welcome to the Tomato Disease Identification project! This repository aims to develop and deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for accurately identifying and classifying diseases affecting tomato plants. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing high-quality images of both healthy and diseased tomato plants.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle at Plant Village Dataset. It includes a diverse collection of images featuring various tomato plant diseases and healthy specimens. Ensure that you download and organize the dataset before proceeding with the training and testing of the CNN models.
